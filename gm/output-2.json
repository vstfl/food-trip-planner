The place is small, with only a couple of tables and counters. Despite this, the menu is remarkably wide and the food is consistently excellent.\n\nThere is only one chef and one waitress. There might be a bit of a wait but it is worth it as the food is not just artfully presented but prepared with perfect technique.\n\nThe seasoning is on point; the chef is tasting and adjusting her flavour profiles. I rarely finish my miso soup but the one here is so full-bodied and satisfying, seemingly made from scratch (that is, by simmering kelp as opposed to rehydrating from powder), that I eagerly finished every last drop.\n\nFinal point: Price. You can still get lunch at the $10 price point here. Hallelujah!",

Last night, we didn't order it. Instead, a range of other items.\nThe only reason I rated it short of five stars was because the portions could be increased slightly (in my opinion). Other than that, I still think that the food, service and atmosphere were excellent!\nWith service, they were slower to respond. It was a very busy night, especially having a jazz band play. Therefore, taking orders, refilling water, tending to customers, and providing the bill were slower. As we haven't visited regularly, I'm not sure if it's because of having live music (more patrons) but it was evident that there were only a few people on the floor. The handsome man at the bar also helped out with table service.\nThe atmosphere was as I remembered - simple but with character. It doesn't get much better than this. It feels homey and comfortable as a restaurant.\nFood-wise, the Korean hot chicken was excellent! It wasn't very spicy, but that's subjective. We loved how the meat was smooth and juicy still.\nThe burger was also excellent! You can't compare it to something like 'Fat Burger' (entirely different styles and cuisines) but it was impressive. It certainly beats places like Earls, etc. in our views.\nAnd the Pacific cod was amazing too! You can tell the quality is different.\nIn every dish, it was evident that the food was fresh and freshly made. No nonsense here!\nWe ended up with a bill just over $100 (not including tips). I think that's pretty reasonable, but, again, a slight increase to the portions would perfect it in our opinions.\nParking is available on the streets.\nThey accept all forms of payments.",

            "text": "I'd had my eye on Dosanko for quite awhile and we finally got to try it out! This isn't your run of the mill Japanese restaurant. There's no sushi to be found on their menu. They are described as a Japanese Homestyle Yoshoku Restaurant. Yoshoku is a term which refers to Western food, so Dosanko serves up Japanse dishes with Western influence.\n\nMugi Cha\nGrape Calpico Soda\nKinpira\nCrispy Cheesy Onigiri\nFarm Vegetable Tempura\nBeef Belly Katsu Sandwich\nOmu Rice\nPacific Cod Fish Katsu\n\nWe'd had a Cheese Yaki Onigiri in Seattle earlier this year, and until now I didn't know of any places within Vancouver that served it. Even Takenaka's Onigiri Cafe, which is Vancouver's one and only dedicated Onigiri restaurant, does not have a Cheese Onigiri on their menu. Dosanko not only impressed us by having Cheesy Onigiri on their menu, but they also managed to cook it better than the one we had in Seattle!\n\nWe'd been happy already with the one in Seattle, but that was because it was the first and only Cheese Onigiri we'd ever had. There was no basis of comparison. After trying this one from Dosanko, there's no way we'd go back to the one in Seattle. Upon a first glance, Dosanko's Cheesy Onigiri was paler in colour and didn't look as attractive as the one we had in Seattle. Biting into it was a different story though. It was way less greasy than the one in Seattle, and so it felt better in our stomachs.\n\n\"O mu goodness,\" the Omu Rice was soooo good! They gave us plenty of tomato sauce for the Omu Rice too, so we were able to pour some of the extra tomato sauce onto the plain rice that came with one of the other dishes.\n\nEvery other dish was executed to perfection as well. This was such a wonderful meal and we will definitely be back sometime to try out their lunch special!\n\nFive stars for the foods; however, it was a hot summer's day and there was no air conditioning in the restaurant, so....4 stars overall when factoring in the ambiance.\n\nService: Good\nParking: Paid parking on the street.

Love how they support local farmers and have unique high quality ingredients.\n\nWhen I was poor college student, I usually got the okonomiyaki or one of the stone bowls, one caterpillar roll, and 1 dessert and that was enough to satisfy me and my friend. I usually got something that was high in carbs that way it fills me up. That way it doesn't go over my budget.\n\nNow, I get anything from their special menu, it's always different depending on the seasons. I am never disappointed what I am about to taste.\n\nThe service is good and friendly!\n\nThe atmosphere there is calming, chill, classy. The music in that restaurant is very relaxing in my opinion.\n\nAlso, the tables are always clean and same with the dishes and cutlery.\n\nTip: This place is quite popular so the wait time to get a table might take long (1hr +). So I suggest you make a reservation, come at 5pm, or eat a small snack before you go but that depends on your eating schedule.",

The rice was very stale for all 5 dishes we ordered. Maybe just an off day? Giving them the benefit of the doubt here since the staff were friendly and attentive but I didn’t want to send the food back.

The chirashi sushi is fresh and filling. Miso soup and vinegared octopus were ok.\nThe service of a nice Japanese woman was pleasant. By the time I finished eating, the restaurant was full of other customers. The inside of the store is not large and it was a hot and humid day, but the A/C was not working very well.\nI will be back again!",

Had the typical sushi rolls.  I recommend the prawn gyoza.  The takoyaki was deep fried, tasty but the texture was more like a fritter.  I prefer the traditional way of making takoyaki.\n\nDrop me a comment or a like if you found this helpful",

I don't think I've left a sushi restaurant before and not still felt a bit hungry afterwards. I did finish all the food, and felt like I didn't need to eat again for a week!\nThe service was excellent as well, they were very on top of refilling water glasses and tea, checked on how our food was, very pleasant server.

The rolls were GREAT sized; in fact perfect. My first bite I actually had an explosion of each independent flavour coming together. It was like in FOOD WARS when the song comes on and someone has a FOODGASM. Both rolls were BOMB BOMB BOMB; so I proceeded to order a SAKE in-line🍒, alongside a Chicken Curry Katsu. Providing a detailed video of each dish; photos of the menu for you to enjoy and the SAKE/Atmosphere. Giving the atmosphere a 5/5 because of the music. 🎶Don’t miss out on this friends =).

Ramen was awesome - rich and creamy but not too heavy. Noodles al dente was perfect match. My 9 yo cleaned the bowl. Carpaccio was great, sometimes the avocado overpowering the rest of the ingredients as the tuna was so good. Pressed salmon was seared, had a Smokey aroma and flavor but thought it was overpowered by the rice and sauce. My ebi, I liked the least and wouldn’t order again. It wasn’t crispy, as expected of Japanese tempura, but soft, perhaps too much mayo.\n\nOverall would recommend as there are plenty of dishes to try and had great service and ambience.",
